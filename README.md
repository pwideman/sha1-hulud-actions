# find-sha1-hulud-users

A custom GitHub action to find Enterprise Organization members and outside collaborators with potential Sha1-Hulud activity.

## Overview

This action helps identify GitHub Enterprise users that may have been compromised by the Sha1-Hulud worm. It performs the following steps:

1. **Enumerate Organizations**: Fetches all organizations in the specified GitHub Enterprise
2. **Search for Infected Repositories**: Searches GitHub for public repositories containing the Sha1-Hulud signature ("Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming")
3. **Check User Memberships**: For each repository owner found, checks if they are a member or outside collaborator of any enterprise organization (with concurrent API requests and caching)
4. **Generate Reports**: Produces a workflow summary with statistics and a detailed table, plus a CSV artifact for further analysis

## Usage

```yaml
- name: Find Sha1-Hulud Users
  uses: pwideman/find-sha1-hulud-users@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.ENTERPRISE_TOKEN }}
    enterprise: 'your-enterprise-slug'
```

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `github-token` | GitHub token with `admin:org` read permissions to access enterprise organizations and check membership | Yes |
| `enterprise` | The slug of the GitHub Enterprise to scan for potentially compromised users | Yes |

### Token Permissions

The GitHub token needs the following permissions:
- `read:org` - To list organizations in the enterprise
- `read:enterprise` - To enumerate enterprise organizations
- Organization membership read access for all organizations in the enterprise

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `users-found` | Number of unique users with Sha1-Hulud repositories found in enterprise organizations |
| `repos-found` | Number of Sha1-Hulud repositories found |

## Artifacts

The action produces a CSV artifact named `sha1-hulud-users` containing:
- Username
- Profile URL
- Repository Count
- Repository URLs
- Whether the user has enterprise membership
- List of organization memberships and their type (member or outside collaborator)
