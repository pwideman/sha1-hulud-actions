# find-sha1-hulud-users

A custom GitHub action to find Enterprise Organization members and outside collaborators with potential Sha1-Hulud activity.

## Overview

This action helps identify GitHub Enterprise users that may have been compromised by the Sha1-Hulud worm. Sha1-Hulud
exfiltrates secrets by creating public repositories in the personal user space of compromised users. This action searches
for all public repositories created by Sha1-Hulud (description includes "Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming") then for each
repository owner, determines whether that user is an organization member or outside collaborator for all organizations
in the provided enterprise.

## Usage

```yaml
- name: Find Sha1-Hulud Users
  uses: pwideman/find-sha1-hulud-users@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.ENTERPRISE_TOKEN }}
    enterprise: 'your-enterprise-slug'
    output-dir: 'reports'
```
